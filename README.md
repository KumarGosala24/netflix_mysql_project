  show_id VARCHAR(20),
  type VARCHAR(20),
  title TEXT,
  director TEXT,
  cast TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  date_added VARCHAR(50),
  release_year INT,

```

### Business Problems and Solutions
___
#### 1. count the number of movies vs Tv shows
```sql
select type, count(*) as total_content
from netflix_data 
group by type;
```
#### 2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows
```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
#### 3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_data
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND release_year = 2020;
```
#### 4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
#### 5. Identify the longest movie
```sql
select * from netflix_data 
where 
type = 'Movie'
and 
duration = (select max(duration) from netflix_data);
```
#### 6. Find content added in the last 5 years
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_data
WHERE STR_TO_DATE(date_added, '%M %d, %Y') >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 5 YEAR;
```
#### 7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_data
WHERE director = 'Rajiv Chilaka'; 
```
#### 8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons

FROM netflix_data
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED) > 5;
  ```
#### 9. Count the number of content items in each genre
```sql
SELECT listed_in AS genre, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY listed_in
ORDER BY total DESC;
```
#### 10. Top 5 years with highest average content released in India

SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_data
WHERE country LIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_data
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND listed_in LIKE '%Documentary%';
```
#### 12. Find all content without a director

FROM netflix_data
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND `cast` LIKE '%Salman Khan%'
  AND release_year >= YEAR(CURDATE()) - 10;
  ```
#### 14. Top 10 actors with highest number of movies produced in India
```sql
SELECT actor, COUNT(*) AS total_movies
FROM (
  SELECT TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`cast`, ',', n.n), ',', -1)) AS actor
  FROM netflix_data
  JOIN (
    SELECT a.N + b.N * 10 + 1 AS n
    FROM (SELECT 0 AS N UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9) a,
         (SELECT 0 AS N UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9) b
  ) n
  ON n.n <= 1 + LENGTH(`cast`) - LENGTH(REPLACE(`cast`, ',', ''))
  WHERE type = 'Movie' AND country LIKE '%India%'
) AS actor_list
GROUP BY actor
ORDER BY total_movies DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
#### 15. Categorize the content based on the presence of the keywords 'kill' and 'violence' in the description field. Label content containing these keywords as 'Bad' and all other content as 'Good'. Count how many items fall into each category.

  COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY category;
```
#### 16 Has Netflix increased or decreased content production over the years?
